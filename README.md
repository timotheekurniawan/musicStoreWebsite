# Tim's Tunes (Music Store Website)

## About

This website was created for the final project of the course COMP3322 "Modern Technologies on World Wide Web" provided by the University of Hong Kong. I created this full-stack website by myself using the knowledge and technologies taught in class. This website is basically a music catalog where customers would be able to order music tracks online. All the music tracks are stored in a database hosted in MongoDB Atlas. All the accounts of customers, and their respective carts are also stored in this database. Here all all the languages and tools that I used in creating this website:

- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- JQuery
- Node.js
- Pug
- MongoDB Atlas
- Mongoose
- Express.js

## How to start web server

   1) npm install
   2) npm install -g nodemon
   3) node mdb-init.js (this .js file runs all the commands in MDBdata.txt; to initialize database)
   3) nodemon app.js
   4) browse "localhost:3000"
